Repo for a geonomics demo simulation I made the 2021 Evolution conference.

Simulation is of locally adapted sasquatch evolving under climate change.

Data come from Dr. Jeff Lozier:

  - habitat suitability, from an ENM, created for Lozier et al. 2009
  - selective environmental graidents, from the two most important covariates from that ENM (bio8 and bio19 from bioclim)
