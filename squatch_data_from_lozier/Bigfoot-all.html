<CENTER><H1>Maxent model for Bigfoot-all</H1></CENTER>
<br> This page contains some analysis of the Maxent model for Bigfoot-all, created Tue Feb 24 11:18:19 CST 2009 using Maxent version 3.1.0.  If you would like to do further analyses, the raw data used here is linked to at the end of this page.<br>
<br><HR><H2>Analysis of omission/commission</H2>
The following picture shows the omission rate and predicted area as a function of the cumulative threshold.  The omission rate is is calculated both on the training presence records, and (if test data are used) on the test records.  The omission rate should be close to the predicted omission, because of the definition of the cumulative threshold.

<br> The next picture is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the same data.  Note that the specificity is defined using predicted area, rather than true commission (see the paper by Phillips, Anderson and Schapire cited on the help page for discussion of what this means).  This implies that the maximum achievable AUC is less than 1.  If test data is drawn from the Maxent distribution itself, then the maximum possible test AUC would be 0.970 rather than 1; in practice the test AUC may exceed this bound.

<br>
Some common thresholds and corresponding omission rates are as follows.  If test data are available, binomial probabilities are calculated exactly if the number of test samples is at most 25, otherwise using a normal approximation to the binomial.  These are 1-sided p-values for the null hypothesis that test points are predicted no better than by a random prediction with the same fractional predicted area.  The "Balance" threshold minimizes 6 * training omission rate + .04 * cumulative threshold + 1.6 * fractional predicted area.<br>

The following picture shows where clamping occurred while projecting the Maxent model onto the environmental variables in C:\Users\Jeff Lozier\Research\Bigfoot ENM\Revision\CCM5arcmin-reducedset.  Clamping means that environmental values are restricted to the range of values encountered during training, and similarly for the raw predictions.  The values shown in the picture give the total absolute change to the exponent in the Maxent model due to clamping.  Warmer colors show areas where more clamping has occurred because the environemtal variables (or the prediction) are further from the range of values seen during training.

<br><HR><H2>Response curves</H2>
<br>These curves show how each environmental variable affects the Maxent prediction.  The (raw) Maxent model has the form exp(...)/constant, and the curves show how the exponent changes as each environmental variable is varied, keeping all other environmental variables at their average sample value.

<br><HR><H2>Analysis of variable contributions</H2><br>
The following table gives a heuristic estimate of relative contributions of the environmental variables to the Maxent model.  To determine the estimate, in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding variable, or subtracted from it if the change to the absolute value of lambda is negative.  As with the jackknife, variable contributions should be interpreted with caution when the predictor variables are correlated.<br>
<br><table border cols=2><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Percent contribution<tr align=right><td>BIO19</td><td>60.7</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO9</td><td>15.2</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO8</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO1</td><td>5.4</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO15</td><td>3.9</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO2</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO7</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO3</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr align=right><td>BIO18</td><td>0.5</td></tr></table><br><br>
The following picture shows the results of the jackknife test of variable importance.  The environmental variable with highest gain when used in isolation is BIO19, which therefore appears to have the most useful information by itself.  The environmental variable that decreases the gain the most when it is omitted is BIO19, which therefore appears to have the most information that isn't present in the other variables.<br>
<br><img src="plots\Bigfoot-all_jacknife.png"><br>
<br>The next picture shows the same jackknife test, using test gain instead of training gain.  Note that conclusions about which variables are most important can change, now that we're looking at test data.
<br><img src="plots\Bigfoot-all_jacknife_test.png"><br>
<br>Lastly, we have the same jackknife test, using AUC on test data.
